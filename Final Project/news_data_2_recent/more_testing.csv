0,"Mr. Biden’s re-election bid and his renewed pledge to achieve his first-term policy goals have forced some reflection and frustration among Black voters in battleground states. Many believe that the big promises he made to Black communities have fallen flat.

Democrats can feel confident that if Mr. Biden is his party’s nominee, as expected, a vast majority of Black voters will choose him over a Republican. But the question for the party is whether Democratic voters will bring the same level of energy that led to Mr. Biden’s 2020 victory.

In his campaign announcement, Mr. Biden made no secret of the importance of Black voters to his re-election. The Biden allies with the most airtime in his three-minute video, aside from his wife, were Vice President Kamala Harris, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and the Rev. Al Sharpton.


“I have not found a lack of enthusiasm,” said Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, who was Mr. Biden’s most important Black surrogate in 2020. “I just haven’t found it. And people keep saying it. But it’s not there.”

Mr. Biden’s allies maintain that his administration has delivered for Black voters but that he has failed to trumpet some of his progress. Since taking office, he has provided billions of dollars for historically Black colleges and universities, and he has appointed more Black judges, including Justice Jackson, to the federal bench than any other president. Black unemployment is at a record low. The economy, a top concern for Black voters, has recovered from its pandemic doldrums, though inflation, which spiked last summer, remains higher on a sustained basis than it has been for decades.

“The president and vice president have made issues Black Americans care most about a priority and are running to finish the job,” said Kevin Munoz, a spokesman for Mr. Biden’s campaign. “The campaign will work hard to earn every vote and expand on its winning 2020 coalition.”

The share of Black voters in the electorate dropped by 1 percent nationally from 2018 to 2022, the biggest drop of any racial group measured, while the share of white, college-educated voters increased, according to data from HIT Strategies, a Democratic polling firm.

It does not take much of a decrease in Black voters to alter the outcome of elections in the most competitive states. In 2020, Mr. Biden won Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Wisconsin, each by fewer than 35,000 votes.

The number of ballots cast for Democratic Senate candidates by voters in Milwaukee — home to a large majority of Wisconsin’s Black population — dropped by 18 percent from 2018 to 2022, while the statewide turnout remained the same, according to Wisconsin voter data. Had Milwaukee delivered the same margin for Democrats in 2022 that it did in 2018, Mandela Barnes, a Democrat, would have defeated Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican.

The city’s mayor, Cavalier Johnson, attributed the difference in part to Republican efforts in Wisconsin to make voting harder — particularly after Mr. Biden’s narrow victory there in 2020.

Mr. Johnson cited an array of Mr. Biden’s accomplishments for Black voters: He appointed the first Black woman, Justice Jackson, to the Supreme Court. He has emphasized the creation of manufacturing jobs, which were once the heartbeat of Milwaukee but have been moved overseas. And, Mr. Johnson added, Black voters credit Mr. Biden for trying to make voting laws less restrictive, even if his efforts failed.

“They know that Joe Biden stood in the breach and stood up for them and fought to build the economy that’s beneficial for people of color, namely African Americans, and also fought against some of the hate and discrimination against people of color and African Americans,” Mr. Johnson said.

Some Black voters said in interviews that their frustrations with the pace of change promised by Mr. Biden in 2020 had led them to question whether they would support him again, or perhaps sit out the next election.

Jennifer Roberts, 35, is a lifelong Democrat and was one of the Black Georgians who helped elect Mr. Biden and Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. She was confident in 2020 that Ms. Harris, the first woman of color to become vice president, would use her background to advance policies related to women of color, and “was praying for them to win.”

Three years later, Ms. Roberts’s view of Mr. Biden’s promises has changed. Her mother moved in with her because of rising rent costs in Metro Atlanta. Inflation has put an added strain on the tow-truck business she and her husband own.

Ms. Roberts now says she would support former President Donald J. Trump if he were the Republican nominee next year. What she wants, and has not yet received, is “tangible help” — and she believes Mr. Trump’s economic policies could possibly provide it.

“I understand he’s tried,” she said of Mr. Biden. “When you don’t address the things directly, when they don’t go according to what you said publicly they were going to, you can’t just kind of sweep it under the rug.”

In Philadelphia, Lamont Wilson, 45, an information technology manager, voted for Mr. Biden in 2020 but said he was not inspired by any 2024 candidates so far. He said Mr. Biden had “done a lot of good” but had not fulfilled his expectations.

Mr. Wilson said he hoped Mr. Biden would “hold firm” on his promise to eliminate student debt — the president announced a $400 billion plan to forgive up to $20,000 of debt for certain people, though the Supreme Court may block it. Black college graduates carry an average of $25,000 more in student loan debt than white college graduates, according to the Education Department.

“Get rid of that debt and give people a chance,” Mr. Wilson said.

Nocola Hemphill, an activist and state party delegate in Winnsboro, S.C., said she had also heard grumblings from Black voters about Mr. Biden. But she saw this as a form of accountability, not evidence of a deeper problem.

“Everyone is not happy with the administration,” she said. “And it’s not that we don’t want to see Biden run. We just want to make sure that he’s going to deliver on his promises.”

Younger, first-time Black voters such as Evan Spann, 19, a freshman at Morehouse College in Atlanta, are also hoping Mr. Biden will deliver. Mr. Spann said he wanted to hear concrete plans from Mr. Biden for his second term.

“I think what he needs to do is directly say what he’s going to do,” Mr. Spann said. “And then I think he needs to really show up and talk to us about it.”

Mr. Biden’s proponents say that while some Black voters may be frustrated with the party, Democrats remain a safer choice than Republicans, who have opposed the legislation protecting voting rights and cutting student loan debt that Black lawmakers and voters have championed. In several G.O.P.-controlled state legislatures, lawmakers have sought to cut Black history lessons from school curriculums, outlaw books by Black authors and have drawn congressional maps that curb Black voting power.

Democrats plan to underline the G.O.P.’s record on these issues.

“Black voters understand all that,” Mr. Clyburn said. “And we’re going to spend a lot of time this year and next reminding them of who is doing this.” At the same time, Democrats must win over voters who are reluctant to support the party again.

“It’s a difficult conversation to go back into those communities and explain why we didn’t get criminal justice reform,” said Kevin Harris, a former executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus. “It’s a difficult conversation to go into those communities and talk about why we didn’t get the protections that we need with voting rights.”

He continued: “That’s a hard conversation to have. But you still go have it.”",0,facts/nyt
1,"TASHKENT, April 30 (Reuters) - Uzbekistan votes on constitutional amendments on Sunday that promise its citizens greater social protection in exchange for resetting President Shavkat Mirziyoyev's term count to zero, which could allow him to stay in power until 2040.

Mirziyoyev, 65, has been praised at home and abroad as a liberal reformer for abandoning the previous leadership's isolationist policies and police state approach.

And while Tashkent's Western partners are unlikely to approve of the attempt to extend presidential powers, Uzbekistan risks little given the West is seeking support from all ex-Soviet nations in its efforts to isolate Russia.

Although the current and the proposed new version of the constitution limit successive presidential terms to two, officials have said that if the revised constitution is adopted Mirziyoyev's term count would be reset to zero.

The reform also extends the presidential term to seven years from five, which could in theory allow Mirziyoyev to remain in charge of the country of 35 million people until 2040.

At the same time, the package of amendments proclaims Uzbekistan a ""social state"" with increased welfare obligations and allows non-farming land ownership.

It also abolishes the death penalty and establishes greater personal legal protection, for instance to a person's rights when they are detained by police, and the concept of habeas corpus, or protection against unlawful and indefinite imprisonment.

Some Uzbek commentators have called for more democratic principles to be included in the bill, and in stronger wording, but the general idea of reform - and extending presidential powers in particular - has met no opposition.

The referendum will be declared valid if over a half of Uzbekistan's 19.7 million voters participate. Preliminary vote results are expected on Monday.",0,facts/reuters
2,"A Texas man went next door with a rifle and fatally shot five of his neighbors, including an 8-year-old boy, after they asked him to stop firing rounds in his yard because they were trying to sleep, authorities said Saturday.

The suspect, identified as 38-year-old Francisco Oropeza, remained at large more than 18 hours after the shooting and authorities warned that he might still be armed. The attack happened just before midnight Friday near the town of Cleveland, north of Houston, on a street where some residents say it is not uncommon to hear neighbors unwind by firing off guns.

San Jacinto County Sheriff Greg Capers said Oropeza used an AR-style rifle, and as the search for him dragged into Saturday evening, authorities had widened their efforts to as far as “10 to 20 miles” from the murder scene. He said Oropeza may still have a weapon but that he believes authorities have the rifle used in the shooting.

Capers said they found clothes and a phone while combing a rural area that includes dense layers of forest but that tracking dogs had lost the scent.

“He could be anywhere now,” Capers said.

Capers said the victims were between the ages of 8 and 31 years old and that all were believed to be from Honduras. All were shot “from the neck up,” he said.

The attack was the latest act of gun violence in what has been a record pace of mass shootings in the U.S. so far this year, some of which have also involved semiautomatic rifles.

The mass killings have played out in a variety of places — a Nashville school, a Kentucky bank, a Southern California dance hall, and now a rural Texas neighborhood inside a single-story home.

Capers said there were 10 people in the house — some of whom had just moved there earlier in the week — but that that no one else was injured. He said two of the victims were found in a bedroom laying over two children in an apparent attempt to shield them.

A total of three children found covered in blood in the home were taken to a hospital but found to be uninjured, Capers said.

FBI spokesperson Christina Garza said investigators do not believe everyone at the home were members of a single family. The victims were identified as Sonia Argentina Guzman, 25; Diana Velazquez Alvarado, 21; Julisa Molina Rivera, 31; Jose Jonathan Casarez, 18; and Daniel Enrique Laso, 8.

The confrontation followed the neighbors walking up to the fence and asking the suspect to stop shooting rounds, Capers said. The suspect responded by telling them that it was his property, Capers said, and one person in the house got a video of the suspect walking up to the front door with the rifle.

The shooting took place on a rural pothole-riddled street where single-story homes sit on wide 1-acre lots and are surrounded by a thick canopy of trees. A horse could be seen behind the victim’s home, while in the front yard of Oropeza’s house a dog and chickens wandered.

Rene Arevalo Sr., who lives a few houses down, said he heard gunshots around midnight but didn’t think anything of it.

“It’s a normal thing people do around here, especially on Fridays after work,” Arevalo said. “They get home and start drinking in their backyards and shooting out there.”

Capers said his deputies had been to Oropeza’s home at least once before and spoken with him about “shooting his gun in the yard.” It was not clear whether any action was taken at the time. At a news conference Saturday evening, the sheriff said firing a gun on your own property can be illegal, but he did not say whether Oropeza had previously broken the law.

Capers said the new arrivals in the home had moved from Houston earlier in the week, but he said he did not know whether they were planning to stay there.

Across the U.S. since Jan. 1, there have been at least 18 shootings that left four or more people dead, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today, in partnership with Northeastern University. The violence is sparked by a range of motives: murder-suicides and domestic violence; gang retaliation; school shootings; and workplace vendettas.

Texas has confronted multiple mass shootings in recent years, including last year’s attack at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde; a racist attack at an El Paso Walmart in 2019; and a gunman opening fire at a church in the tiny town of Sutherland Springs in 2017.

Republican leaders in Texas have continually rejected calls for new firearm restrictions, including this year over the protests of several families whose children were killed in Uvalde.

A few months ago, Arevalo said Oropeza threatened to kill his dog after it got loose in the neighborhood and chased the pit bull in his truck.

“I tell my wife all the time, ‘Stay away from the neighbors. Don’t argue with them. You never know how they’re going to react,’” Arevalo said. “I tell her that because Texas is a state where you don’t know who has a gun and who is going to react that way.”",0,facts/ap

President Franklin Roosevelt launched a war against the Great Depression. President Lyndon Johnson launched a war against poverty. President Ronald Reagan launched a war against communism. Gov. Ron DeSantis – a potential 2024 candidate – has decided to launch his war against Disney, one of America’s most iconic companies and a crucial source of revenue for his home state of Florida.

The conflict between the up-and-coming Republican and the company behind Mickey Mouse started when Disney, responding to protests from its own employees, criticized the “Don’t Say Gay” bill limiting discussions about sexual and gender identity in the classroom.

DeSantis, who signed the bill into law, decided to take punitive action, stripping the company of its privileged tax status and creating a new board to oversee Disney’s special taxing district. Not to be outfoxed, Disney struck a multi-decade deal with the outgoing board members days before the new, DeSantis-appointed one took over.

After the new board rendered the agreement null and void, Disney struck back with force and filed a lawsuit against the governor and his oversight board, claiming that he weaponized his political power to punish the company for exercising its free speech rights. With each side digging its heels in, the conflict is turning into a quagmire.

For DeSantis, this has been a terrible political move. As former President Donald Trump ramps ups his campaign, DeSantis is struggling to keep up. With his war on Disney, the governor has taken yet another step away from being the “most electable” Republican of the pack.

Why is the decision so damaging?

For one, DeSantis is boxing himself in as a right-wing cultural warrior. Initially, one of his biggest political assets was his ability to build the kind of coalition others in his party found so difficult, having made significant inroads among Latino voters in Florida.

DeSantis also touted his executive record of promoting economic growth and his handling of the pandemic. During the 2022 campaign, DeSantis released an ad – reminiscent of Reagan’s famous “Morning Again in America” ad of 1984 –stressing how people went to work and kids went to school when many other states shut down during the pandemic.

By picking a fight with Disney, however, DeSantis ends up distracting voters from his governing abilities and ends up looking like a slightly more polished version of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. While many Republicans love the culture wars, it is far from clear that it is a winning strategy in a national election.

It’s also not a great look for a potential Republican presidential candidate to go after corporate America. Despite all the talk about conservative populism, the reality is that big business remains a central constituency of the GOP. The party’s supply side and deregulatory economic policies have always been at the heart of the political coalition the GOP built since Reagan’s presidency.

DeSantis seems to be playing into the GOP’s rhetoric about populism while overlooking the reality that wealthier Americans and business executives make up a key component of the base. Watching a governor go after a major company in his own state — at the same time that House Republicans are creating unnecessary economic instability by threatening to not raise the debt ceiling — will certainly rattle corporations that want stability, predictability, hands-off government and profit. They certainly don’t want to be thinking about a possible president who seems willing to take punitive action against a company for saying something that could suddenly be branded as “woke.”

It’s also odd that DeSantis has chosen to go after a company that is one of the most iconic cultural products of modern American history. Disney is in many ways a symbol of the very wholesome family values that Republicans try to align themselves with.

And if the point is to demonstrate that he is a fighter, the governor will never be able to match Trump on this front. Trying to take the former president on in this manner is a fool’s errand. As so many other Republicans before him have learned, this is one arena where Trump is almost impossible to defeat and very few voters will be convinced that DeSantis can ever match him in the realm of political combat.

Highlighting many of the pitfalls of DeSantis’ feud with Disney, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley tweeted: “Hey @Disney, my home state will happily accept your 70,000+ jobs if you want to leave Florida. We’ve got great weather, great people, and it’s always a great day in South Carolina! SC’s not woke, but we’re not sanctimonious about it either.”

DeSantis’s decision on Disney has been a self-inflicted wound that will do irreparable damage to a potential campaign. He is very quickly joining the long list of politically promising governors, such as Texas’s Rick Perry and Florida’s Jeb Bush, who flame out under the glare of the national spotlight.",1,opinion/cnn
4,"Your beer hates you. So does your phone. And your car, your food, your sports team and most businesses you deal with in a given day. Ask Budweiser. Or Disney.

American companies have embraced every crazy leftist agenda item imaginable – the latest being the trans insanity sweeping the nation. Call it Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) or their Corporate Equality Index (CEI). No matter how you spell it, it comes out the same. 

They. Hate. You. 

Bud Light was just the reminder du jour. Anheuser-Busch, which owns Budweiser, placed two marketing executives on leave because they deliberately attacked the core audience of the beer. Think of it as a tiny victory in a landscape of losses.  

Tiny and temporary. 

They weren’t fired because they hate you. They were put on leave. Top Budweiser executives are betting it all blows over. And these two come back to their jobs or similar ones. Then it all starts over. 

So let’s recap, shall we? Bud Light didn’t just try to expand its business model by reaching out to the LGBTQ community. It openly declared war on its customers. The brand cut a deal with strange trans activist and social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney. 

Before you could say ""transbeer"" Mulvaney was proudly showing off Bud Light cans with the activist’s face plastered all over them. It was part of Mulvaney’s bizarre ""365 Days of Girlhood"" series describing the transgender life on TikTok. 

This wasn’t an accident. Bud Light's vice president of marketing Alissa Heinerscheid said she had a ""mandate"" to fix the brand because of the horrible people who drank the beer.  

""We had this hangover, I mean Bud Light had been kind of a brand of fratty, kind of out of touch humor, and it was really important that we had another approach,"" she said. 

She emphasized the word ""inclusivity,"" but what she meant is everybody but the people who already drank the beer. Everybody but you. This is the barley, rice, hops and water equivalent of how the media treat conservatives. You don’t matter and if you say anything, they call you a bigot. 

This isn’t a New Coke mistake. This is a deliberate corporate move to give the finger to its customers. The only reason Heinerscheid is on leave is she was so stupidly obvious about it. As they say online, she said the quiet part out loud. 

All across the U.S., companies are doing the exact same thing. They just don’t go public and bash their ""fratty"" customers. The New York Post reports Mulvaney’s act has generated a million dollars from brands like Ulta Beauty, Haus Labs, Crest, InstaCart and CeraVe. One million dollars that you paid them. 

So let’s boycott those brands, too, you say. Good luck. You can’t even boycott Budweiser.  

I don’t fault people for trying – whether it’s a quiet boycott or a Kid Rockian protest. It’s just doomed. Drop Bud Light and you have to boycott Budweiser, Busch, Michelob, Stella Artois, and many others. The company also has at least 20 craft beer ""partners"" and produces five products it considers ""Beyond Beer."" You can get beyond beer, but just not beyond Budweiser. 

And, even if miraculously you manage, many of its competitors are just as bad. If you boycott one, the new company executives will laugh at you, too. They’ll just be savvier about it and do it quietly.  

It was the same with the NFL, Major League Baseball, and Disney. They all know they dominate the marketplace so thoroughly that you have no choice.  

Sure, a boycott can generate some change. Look at football. The fans stood up to the woke protests and the players quit kneeling and stood up, too. The league threw some money at activism and the far-left sportscasters stopped whining about social justice and focused more on the game. The sport went from celebrating wokeness to giving us that old time religion.  

Conservatives didn’t so much win as get somewhat of a return to the status quo. 

In short, it’s rare to muster enough anger to effectively boycott a brand and make it change behavior. I’m not saying don’t try. It just can’t be your only strategy. 

The way to teach businesses a lesson is by first voting with your wallet. Find businesses and individuals you like enough, and support them. If there’s a conservative singer you like, don’t just listen on a streaming service. Buy the album. Same goes for authors, brewers, bakers, and more. 

If the product is good enough, do more than just buy it. Promote it – in the real world as well as online. Tell your friends, family, coworkers and the people at church to do the same.  

New York Times best-selling author Larry Correia was attacked on Goodreads with a one-star review before his upcoming book was even written. Correia, who recently wrote a great pro-gun book called ""In Defense of the Second Amendment,"" got stonewalled by Goodreads. Instead of whining, he told his readers. The next thing he knew, the one-star was swamped by 113 five-star reviews. 

His readers had his back.  

Liberals call something like this a ""buycott."" Only what I am suggesting is much more. We can’t create an entirely separate universe filled with conservative banks, social media, cars and stores, unless you have a few trillion dollars in your pocket. (If you do, please call me.) But when conservatives do produce good products – from movies to beer – we need to buy it, promote it and defend it.

That’s how we win.",1,opinion/fox
5,"WASHINGTON — Your kids may finally have to put their phone down after a bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation to set age restrictions on social media.  

The lawmakers introduced a bill Wednesday that bans children younger than 13 from using social media platforms and requires parental consent for those between the ages of 13 and 17. 

The move is among the first major bipartisan effort in Congress to restrict platforms for children and comes after lawmakers have recently pushed to make online platforms safer for children, including efforts to ban TikTok and regulate Instagram. 

However, parents told USA TODAY they are skeptical of the legislation and whether it would be effective in addressing the rapidly emerging concerns over minors’ use of social media.

“I appreciate a bipartisan effort around this. And I do think it’s important to start building coalitions,” said Samuel Chapman, a 58-year-old California parent whose 16-year-old son died from fentanyl-laced drugs purchased through Snapchat in 2021. “I just don’t see it as the solution.”

Most social media companies already prohibit users under 13 because of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, otherwise known as COPPA. However, it's not strictly enforced.

Chapman and his wife, OWN TV host Dr. Laura Berman, have been large proponents of social media legislation following the death of their son, including advocating for parental monitoring technology on such applications.

Chapman and Berman have advocated for Sammy’s Law – legislation named for their son – which would require major social media companies to allow parents to track their children through third-party monitoring software.

“I’m all for parental permission. I don’t know if codifying will make it happen because everything that’s been put in place by these platforms and by our legislators thus far any 12-year-old has been able to get around,” Chapman added.

“I think they’re using social media as a scapegoat. The mental health crisis – there's a lot of factors that go into it,” Kunkle said.

“Yes, social media has shone a light on that for some of these kids, but I don’t think just blocking or making social media more difficult for children is really going to have any effect on the problem with mental health that we have,"" the 39-year-old father of three added. 

Chris Kunkle, whose children are 10, 15 and 17, voiced similar concerns while also taking issue with lawmakers’ reasoning for the legislation.

Sens. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Katie Britt, R-Ala, introduced the Protecting Kids on Social Media Act aimed to protect children from the harmful effects of social media, emphasizing its impact on mental health.

The senators laid blame directly on social media for the growing mental health crisis, noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 2021 Youth Risk Behavior found poor mental health and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased across nearly all groups of youth.

“For too long big tech has exposed our kids to dangerous content and disturbed people. Moms and Dads have felt helpless while their kids suffered, sometimes leading to devastating tragedies,” Cotton said during the press conference introducing the legislation.

“This bill is a giant step towards fixing that problem. It puts parents back in control and sends an important message: Social media companies have a duty to help keep kids safe and parents informed or face serious consequences,” he added.  

In addition to restricting children under 13 from social media and requiring parental consent for those between the ages of 13 and 17, the proposed legislation, according to the bill text, also includes:

“By instituting these simple, straight forward guidelines we’ll be able to give the next generation of children what every parent wants for their child, which is a chance to grow up happy and healthy,” Schatz said Wednesday.

Bills protect children online
The legislation is not the first targeting children who use social media platforms.

Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill in February – the Making Age-Verification Technology Uniform, Robust, and Effective (MATURE) Act – to require social media platforms to verify that users are at least 16 years old before allowing them onto the platform.

Under Hawley’s bill, individuals would have to provide the platform with their full legal name, date of birth and a scan, image or upload of a form of government-issued identification, which would verify a user’s name and birthday

Hawley also introduced the Federal Social Media Act, a bill that would commission a report to study the impact of social media on users’ mental and physical health of those under the age of 18.

The Missouri lawmaker also led the effort to fast-track a national TikTok ban, before being blocked by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who said such a ban would violate the First Amendment. ",0,facts/usa today

Ted just admitted it.

A recording of a conversation between Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX via Donald Trump’s undercarriage), former Fox News producer Abby Grossberg, and Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo from January 2, 2021, was shared publicly on Tuesday.

First aired by MSNBC’s Ari Melber, the tape was recorded just four days before Trump incited his base to attack the Capitol.

Cruz, who was also the first Senator to object to the Electoral College results that gave Joe Biden the W, lays out a plan that doesn’t sound improvised at all.

They had months to plot after losing in November 2020, which is why Cruz delivers his ideas so smarmily and self-confidently.

Trump’s subhuman toilet/bidet details his own plan to “create an electoral commission” which would be comprised of his fellow compromised co-conspirators.

Cruz’s crooked crew would “assess the false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election” in the hopes of finding any actual fraud so Trump wouldn’t release whatever blackmail he has on all of them.

Bartiromo is heard asking Cruz who would decide which candidate would be inaugurated.





Cruz replies that if the commission “found credible evidence of fraud that undermines confidence in the electoral results in any given state they would report on that.”

Cruz also cites the electoral commission created in 1876 to investigate potential voter fraud in the Hayes-Tilden election.

Because that’s applicable in 2021, according to Harvard Law’s worst graduate.

“You need an adjudicatory body with fact-finding and investigative authority to consider the facts to examine the record and to make determinations — that’s how they did it in 1877,” Cruz told Grossberg and Bartiromo.

Translated into modern English: “Let’s stop the vote and melt with Trump.”

Cruz bragged that he had already gathered 11 senators to object to the electoral certification, which would trigger “a 10-day audit.”

“I think that the country deserves to have a credible assessment of these claims and what the evidence shows and the mechanism to try to force that is denying certification on the sixth,” Cruz says on the tape.

A “credible assessment” made by the very same people who are most invested in keeping Trump in the White House?

Seems bad, Ted.

The comments Cruz makes to Grossberg and the MAGA Money Dummy are similar to public statements he had made, but there are notable exceptions.

Cruz repeated those hot garbage takes on the Senate floor shortly before the MAGA mob attacked Congress on January 6th, but he never mentioned the Compromise of 1877.

However, Cruz and his team tried to turn a scandal into a semantics argument, an overly used MAGA distraction tactic that moves the goalposts away from the topic at hand.

Ted’s team was out on Twitter on Wednesday trying to tell us we didn’t hear what he told Grossberg and the MAGA Money Dummy.
